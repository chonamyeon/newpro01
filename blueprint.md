# Project Blueprint: Netflix-Style Quiz App

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to redesign a simple quiz application to have a clean, modern aesthetic inspired by the Netflix interface. The goal is to create a more engaging and visually appealing user experience.

## Design and Features

### Implemented (Initial Version)

*   **Core Logic:** A simple multi-question quiz that calculates a score and displays a result.
*   **Basic Structure:** A single HTML file with three sections: start, quiz, and result.
*   **Basic Styling:** A dark theme with green accent colors.

### Current Plan: Netflix Redesign

*   **Header:**
    *   A sticky header containing the application's logo. The logo will be a simple, stylized text element: "QUIZFLIX".
*   **Layout:**
    *   A main "hero" section featuring the quiz title and a call-to-action button.
    *   The quiz, loading, and result sections will be presented as modals or distinct "cards" that appear as the user progresses.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Background:** A very dark gray, almost black (`#141414`).
    *   **Primary Accent (Netflix Red):** `#E50914`.
    *   **Text:** White (`#FFFFFF`) and light gray (`#AAAAAA`).
    *   **Card/Modal Background:** A slightly lighter dark gray (`#2F2F2F`).
*   **Typography:**
    *   Use the 'Bebas Neue' font for titles and headings to give a cinematic feel (imported from Google Fonts).
    *   Use 'Helvetica Neue' or a similar sans-serif for body text for readability.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Buttons:** Styled with the Netflix red accent color, with clear hover and active states.
    *   **Cards/Modals:** Rounded corners, subtle borders, and a slight shadow to "lift" them off the background.
    *   **Loader:** A custom loading animation that fits the theme.
*   **Interactivity & Effects:**
    *   Smooth transitions between the start, quiz, and result states.
    *   Subtle hover effects on interactive elements.
    *   A background with a very subtle noise texture to add a premium feel.
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   The layout will be fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
